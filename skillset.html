          <br class="md-none">
          <p>
            My interest for web development started because I needed to give a GUI to one of my applications: "Handsflow" a board game that my friends and I invented as kids.
            I started working with <strong>HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript</strong> to build simple applications such as a cookie clicker, calculators, etc. Very soon, I started designing 
            interfaces with <strong>Bootstrap</strong> principally using their grid system and core components (buttons, responsive navbar, menus). In class, I learned to use JS to implement
            asynchronous requests. This, along with operating a server, opened up an infinte number of ideas of what I could do with web development. I learned <strong>React.JS</strong> to build
            more complex applications such as "The Commons", an academic social network. Using React, I learned to design with <strong>Material UI and Ant Design</strong>. The biggest takeaway
            from my React experience is that I became flexible learning new dependencies <strong>(React Router, PeerJs, etc)</strong> as the complexity and the functionality needs of the app scalated.

          <p>
            Learning back-end development was the last piece of the puzzle for giving full functionality to my applications. As I have experience with <strong>Python</strong>, I decided to learned 
            <strong>Django</strong>. I have created platforms such as as social network, an email service, an aunction site and a wiki. I have used <strong>SQL Lite</strong> to manage the databases of these applications.
            I have also worked with both the built-in Django <strong>session authentication system</strong> as well as third party <strong>token authentitication </strong> frameworks suchs as Rest framework's JWT Auth.
            Recently, to establish peer-to-peer communication in a particular app, I had to step out of my comfort zone and learn <strong>Node.js</strong>.

          <h1>Algorithms and OOP</h1>
          <br class="md-none">
          <p>
            My core coursework is in <strong>C++</strong>. I have worked on simple OOP utility programs that implemented <strong>data structures</strong> such as arrays, vectors, linked lists. On my part, I have
            learned more advanced data sctructures such as hash maps and trees in <strong>Python</strong>. In and out of class I have studied a variety of <strong>algorithms </strong> in sorting, searchinng, recursion up to compound
            algorithms such as file parsing. One of my first independent project was "Handsflow", a game. Using linked lists I created the app in C++ which executed in the terminal. However, I felt the need to give 
            the game a more user friendly GUI, so I began learning web development. In the process I adquired experience translating C++ code into Python and Javascript and strengthen my abilities to design more 
            <strong>compatible and reproducible algorithms</strong>.

          <h1>MATLAB for Engineering</h1>
          <br class="md-none">
          <p>
            I discovered my passion for building software when I was majoring in civil engineering. My interest for finding the most efficient solution to a structural setup led me to self-learn
            MATLAB. I found that most of the processes in structural analysis could be coded into one formula: an algorithm, which reduced the time to reach a solution drastically. I developed utilities
            such as a plotter for the internal forces diagrams on simply supported beams, a plotter for the stress distribution on thin-walled sections, a center of mass calculator for sections, a deflection
            plotter on beams, and others.
